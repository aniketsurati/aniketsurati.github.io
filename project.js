        summary: "A personalised skill development system for young footballers on Ellevate Football.",
        background: "Ellevate Football is a mobile app designed to help young players improve their football skills. One of the biggest challenges users is knowing what to practice, how to measure their progress, and how to stay motivated. Users trained in isolation, making it difficult to track improvements over time. We recognized the need for a structured, data-driven, and gamified approach to skill development—one that not only assessed a player’s current abilities but also provided clear guidance on how to improve.<br><br> Before we built this feature, users engaged with Ellevate primarily through video-based training content without an adaptive learning component. There was no personalised skill tracking, progression system, or structured feedback loop, which meant players often lacked a sense of direction. The challenge was to create a feature that could accurately assess skill levels, recommend tailored training programs, and keep players engaged through an interactive experience. Additionally, we had to balance automation with human skill assessments while also incorporating expert feedback from coaches. To solve this, we introduced the Training Plans feature.",
        role: "As the <b>Head of Product</b>, I led the end-to-end development of this feature, managing a team of four engineers and one product designer. My responsibilities spanned <b>strategy, research, execution, and go-to-market planning</b>. I worked closely with stakeholders to define the product vision, collaborated with engineers to bring the feature to life, and led the marketing efforts to ensure a successful launch.",
        research: "The research phase was crucial to ensuring that the Training Plans feature would be engaging, effective, and commercially viable. We started with <b>user research surveys</b> to identify the pain points young footballers face when training alone. Many users expressed difficulty in knowing what to practice, tracking their progress, and staying motivated without a structured plan. To validate pricing models, we conducted a <b>Van Westendorp pricing survey</b>, which provided insights into how much users and their parents would be willing to pay for premium training plans.<br><br> To enhance engagement, we applied the <b>Octalysis gamification framework</b>, breaking down user motivation into core drivers such as accomplishment, social influence, and unpredictability. We also interviewed <b>coaches, football educators, and sports psychologists</b> to refine our training methodology, ensuring that the drills were structured for progressive skill development. Additionally, we studied various <b>sports science and learning frameworks</b> to understand the best ways to deliver feedback and structure skill improvement in a way that felt rewarding and achievable for young players.",
        planning: "Once we had a solid foundation from our research, we moved into the planning phase. We mapped out the <b>user journey</b>, from the moment a player decides to assess their skills to the point where they complete multiple training cycles and see improvements in their player card. We focused on ensuring a seamless </b>onboarding experience</b>, where users could quickly understand their skill levels through performing three benchmark drills that assessed six core football skills and feel motivated to start improving.<br><br> To make the training process engaging, we designed a <b>structured progression system</b>, where users could choose a skill, follow a personalised plan, and receive feedback at key milestones. Over time, their ratings would adjust, helping them track progress, climb leaderboards, and gain visibility among scouts. We defined key success metrics, such as <b>feature adoption, training completion rates, and skill rating improvements</b>, to measure the impact of the feature. Additionally, we carefully planned the <b>gamification strategy</b>, incorporating elements like leaderboards, achievements, and social sharing to keep users engaged.",
        development: "During development, I worked closely with engineers and designers to build an <b>intuitive and interactive</b> training experience. One of the major challenges was creating an <b>AI-assisted rating system</b> that could standardise drill performances and provide accurate skill assessments across coaches. We built an algorithm that factored in multiple performance metrics, allowing for dynamic adjustments to personalised training plans over time.<br><br> The feedback loop was another crucial component. We implemented a <b>hybrid system</b> where users would receive automated feedback based on predefined metrics but also had the option to get personalised insights from coaches. This ensured that users felt supported in their training journey while keeping the experience scalable. We also focused on making the <b>user interface highly visual and engaging</b>, leveraging animations and progress indicators to make skill progression feel rewarding.",
        launch: "For the launch, we executed a <b>multi-channel go-to-market strategy</b> to maximize adoption. A key component was partnering with <b>Premier League players</b> like Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, and Oscar Bobb, as well as football YouTubers like ChrisMD and SV2. We created engaging <b>social media content, YouTube videos, and ads</b> featuring these players, reinforcing the idea that skill progression in the app could translate to real-world recognition.<br><br> In addition, we organized <b>live activations at the Junior Premier League</b> in the UK. At these events, players performed drills, received skill ratings, and had the chance to earn prizes based on their performance. This hands-on experience helped bridge the gap between digital and physical training, driving both engagement and word-of-mouth growth. Our launch efforts combined <b>organic community-building, influencer marketing, and paid media</b>, leading to strong initial adoption and high user engagement.<br><br> This feature introduced a <b>fundamental shift</b> in how users engaged with Ellevate Football, transforming it from a static training app into a <b>dynamic skill development platform</b> with personalized learning paths and competitive motivation.",
