        summary: "A personalised skill development system for young footballers on Ellevate Football.",
        background: "Ellevate Football is a mobile app designed to help young players improve their football skills. One of the biggest challenges users is knowing what to practice, how to measure their progress, and how to stay motivated. Users trained in isolation, making it difficult to track improvements over time. We recognized the need for a structured, data-driven, and gamified approach to skill development—one that not only assessed a player’s current abilities but also provided clear guidance on how to improve.<br><br> Before we built this feature, users engaged with Ellevate primarily through video-based training content without an adaptive learning component. There was no personalised skill tracking, progression system, or structured feedback loop, which meant players often lacked a sense of direction. The challenge was to create a feature that could accurately assess skill levels, recommend tailored training programs, and keep players engaged through an interactive experience. Additionally, we had to balance automation with human skill assessments while also incorporating expert feedback from coaches. To solve this, we introduced the Training Plans feature.",
        role: "As the <b>Head of Product</b>, I led the end-to-end development of this feature, managing a team of four engineers and one product designer. My responsibilities spanned <b>strategy, research, execution, and go-to-market planning</b>. I worked closely with stakeholders to define the product vision, collaborated with engineers to bring the feature to life, and led the marketing efforts to ensure a successful launch.",
        research: "The research phase was crucial to ensuring that the Training Plans feature would be engaging, effective, and commercially viable. We started with <b>user research surveys</b> to identify the pain points young footballers face when training alone. Many users expressed difficulty in knowing what to practice, tracking their progress, and staying motivated without a structured plan. To validate pricing models, we conducted a <b>Van Westendorp pricing survey</b>, which provided insights into how much users and their parents would be willing to pay for premium training plans.<br><br> To enhance engagement, we applied the <b>Octalysis gamification framework</b>, breaking down user motivation into core drivers such as accomplishment, social influence, and unpredictability. We also interviewed <b>coaches, football educators, and sports psychologists</b> to refine our training methodology, ensuring that the drills were structured for progressive skill development. Additionally, we studied various <b>sports science and learning frameworks</b> to understand the best ways to deliver feedback and structure skill improvement in a way that felt rewarding and achievable for young players.",
        planning: "Once we had a solid foundation from our research, we moved into the planning phase. We mapped out the <b>user journey</b>, from the moment a player decides to assess their skills to the point where they complete multiple training cycles and see improvements in their player card. We focused on ensuring a seamless </b>onboarding experience</b>, where users could quickly understand their skill levels through performing three benchmark drills that assessed six core football skills and feel motivated to start improving.<br><br> To make the training process engaging, we designed a <b>structured progression system</b>, where users could choose a skill, follow a personalised plan, and receive feedback at key milestones. Over time, their ratings would adjust, helping them track progress, climb leaderboards, and gain visibility among scouts. We defined key success metrics, such as <b>feature adoption, training completion rates, and skill rating improvements</b>, to measure the impact of the feature. Additionally, we carefully planned the <b>gamification strategy</b>, incorporating elements like leaderboards, achievements, and social sharing to keep users engaged.",
        development: "During development, I worked closely with engineers and designers to build an <b>intuitive and interactive</b> training experience. One of the major challenges was creating an <b>AI-assisted rating system</b> that could standardise drill performances and provide accurate skill assessments across coaches. We built an algorithm that factored in multiple performance metrics, allowing for dynamic adjustments to personalised training plans over time.<br><br> The feedback loop was another crucial component. We implemented a <b>hybrid system</b> where users would receive automated feedback based on predefined metrics but also had the option to get personalised insights from coaches. This ensured that users felt supported in their training journey while keeping the experience scalable. We also focused on making the <b>user interface highly visual and engaging</b>, leveraging animations and progress indicators to make skill progression feel rewarding.",
        launch: "For the launch, we executed a <b>multi-channel go-to-market strategy</b> to maximize adoption. A key component was partnering with <b>Premier League players</b> like Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, and Oscar Bobb, as well as football YouTubers like ChrisMD and SV2. We created engaging <b>social media content, YouTube videos, and ads</b> featuring these players, reinforcing the idea that skill progression in the app could translate to real-world recognition.<br><br> In addition, we organized <b>live activations at the Junior Premier League</b> in the UK. At these events, players performed drills, received skill ratings, and had the chance to earn prizes based on their performance. This hands-on experience helped bridge the gap between digital and physical training, driving both engagement and word-of-mouth growth. Our launch efforts combined <b>organic community-building, influencer marketing, and paid media</b>, leading to strong initial adoption and high user engagement.<br><br> This feature introduced a <b>fundamental shift</b> in how users engaged with Ellevate Football, transforming it from a static training app into a <b>dynamic skill development platform</b> with personalized learning paths and competitive motivation.",

        summary: "Driving data-driven decision-making to enhance eCommerce performance using A/B Tests.",
        background: "Macy’s, one of the largest retail brands in the US, needed to optimize its eCommerce platform and mobile apps to increase conversion rates, average order value (AOV), and total revenue. Despite having millions of daily visitors, many product and UX decisions were being made based on intuition rather than data. There was no formalized A/B testing framework, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient product investments.<br><br> To address this, I was brought in as a Senior Consultant - Product Management and Analytics to establish a scalable, data-driven experimentation process. Over three years, I led a team of eight specialists, ran 160+ A/B tests, and embedded decision-driven experimentation across 12-15 product teams. Our efforts directly increased order conversion by 8%, AOV by 13%, and contributed $20M+ in annual revenue growth.",
        role: "As the <b>lead for A/B testing at Macy’s</b>, I worked across <b>12-15 product teams</b>, including <b>Search, Checkout, Product View, Add to Bag, Wishlist, and Product Recommendations</b>, to integrate <b>experiment-driven decision-making</b> into their workflows. My responsibilities included:<br><br> 1. <b>Establishing a governance structure</b>, including p-value thresholds, sample size calculations, traffic randomization rules.<br><br> 2. <b>Defining success metrics</b> and statistical significance criteria to ensure reliable results. <br><br> 3. <b>Managing end-to-end experiment execution</b>, from research and hypothesis formulation to development, launch, and analysis.",
        research: "Every experiment started with <b>data-driven problem identification</b>. We analyzed user behavior through <b>SQL queries</b>, looking at drop-off points and inefficiencies across the site and app. We examined <b>NPS scores, CSAT surveys, and user interviews</b> to capture customer sentiment and frustrations. Session replays and heatmaps provided qualitative insights into areas where users struggled. From this data, we <b>uncovered patterns and pain points</b>, such as high cart abandonment rates, friction in the checkout process, and low engagement with product recommendations.<br><br> Once key issues were identified, we <b>formulated clear hypotheses</b> using the null and alternative framework. For example, if a high cart abandonment rate was detected, a hypothesis might be:<br><br> 1. <b>Null Hypothesis (H₀)</b>: Removing extra form fields in checkout will have no impact on conversion rates.<br> 2. <b>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)</b>: Removing extra form fields will increase checkout conversion rates by at least 5%.<br><br> By framing experiments in this structured way, we ensured that every test had a <b>clear objective and measurable success criteria</b> before moving forward.",
        planning: "With a well-defined hypothesis, we moved into the planning phase, where we designed controlled experiments that could yield <b>statistically valid and actionable insights</b>. This involved defining <b>primary and secondary success metrics</b>, such as conversion rate, engagement time, and AOV, while also monitoring overall business health indicators to prevent unintended negative impacts.<br><br> We ran <b>pre-power tests</b> to calculate the required sample size, ensuring that each test had enough data to produce statistically significant results. <b>Traffic was then randomly allocated</b> between control and test groups to maintain comparability and eliminate biases. <b>Test variations were carefully designed</b>, ensuring that UI/UX changes were distinct enough to be measurable while maintaining a seamless experience for users.<br><br>Throughout this process, collaboration was key. I worked closely with product managers, designers, and engineers across multiple teams to align on test objectives and ensure that each experiment fit into Macy’s broader <b>business goals and product roadmap</b>.<br><br> Each A/B test was mapped into a <b>structured experimentation roadmap</b>, ensuring that Macy’s had a continuous pipeline of <b>validated insights driving product enhancements</b>.",
        development: "Once an experiment was planned, we collaborated with engineering teams to <b>build the necessary test variations</b>. This often required working across different components of the Macy’s digital ecosystem, ensuring that changes were accurately implemented and seamlessly integrated into the customer experience. A strong <b>QA process</b> was in place to identify any potential bugs or inconsistencies before launch.<br><br> To enable real-time monitoring, we built <b>custom analytics dashboards</b>, allowing us to track key metrics as the test progressed. These dashboards provided insights into user behavior, engagement, and revenue impact, making it easier to react quickly if any anomalies were detected. The engineering team also worked to minimize <b>performance trade-offs</b>, ensuring that tests did not introduce latency or disrupt the shopping experience.",
        launch: "Once an A/B test was live, we closely monitored its performance, collecting data in real time and ensuring that our <b>sample size thresholds were met</b> before drawing conclusions. Using <b>two-tailed t-tests</b>, we determined whether the observed changes were <b>statistically significant</b>. If the test showed a <b>clear positive impact</b>, we rolled out the variation to all users. If the results were <b>inconclusive</b>, we analyzed the findings, iterated on the approach, and ran follow-up experiments. If the test had <b>negative effects</b>, we quickly rolled it back, ensuring no long-term harm to the business.<br><br> The success of this structured experimentation approach was evident in the results. Beyond the financial gains, our work embedded a culture of <b>data-driven decision-making</b>, ensuring that every major change at Macy’s was backed by rigorous testing and real user insights.",
