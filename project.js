        summary: "A personalised skill development system for young footballers on Ellevate Football.",
        background: "Ellevate Football is a mobile app designed to help young players improve their football skills. One of the biggest challenges users is knowing what to practice, how to measure their progress, and how to stay motivated. Users trained in isolation, making it difficult to track improvements over time. We recognized the need for a structured, data-driven, and gamified approach to skill development—one that not only assessed a player’s current abilities but also provided clear guidance on how to improve.<br><br> Before we built this feature, users engaged with Ellevate primarily through video-based training content without an adaptive learning component. There was no personalised skill tracking, progression system, or structured feedback loop, which meant players often lacked a sense of direction. The challenge was to create a feature that could accurately assess skill levels, recommend tailored training programs, and keep players engaged through an interactive experience. Additionally, we had to balance automation with human skill assessments while also incorporating expert feedback from coaches. To solve this, we introduced the Training Plans feature.",
        role: "As the <b>Head of Product</b>, I led the end-to-end development of this feature, managing a team of four engineers and one product designer. My responsibilities spanned <b>strategy, research, execution, and go-to-market planning</b>. I worked closely with stakeholders to define the product vision, collaborated with engineers to bring the feature to life, and led the marketing efforts to ensure a successful launch.",
        research: "The research phase was crucial to ensuring that the Training Plans feature would be engaging, effective, and commercially viable. We started with <b>user research surveys</b> to identify the pain points young footballers face when training alone. Many users expressed difficulty in knowing what to practice, tracking their progress, and staying motivated without a structured plan. To validate pricing models, we conducted a <b>Van Westendorp pricing survey</b>, which provided insights into how much users and their parents would be willing to pay for premium training plans.<br><br> To enhance engagement, we applied the <b>Octalysis gamification framework</b>, breaking down user motivation into core drivers such as accomplishment, social influence, and unpredictability. We also interviewed <b>coaches, football educators, and sports psychologists</b> to refine our training methodology, ensuring that the drills were structured for progressive skill development. Additionally, we studied various <b>sports science and learning frameworks</b> to understand the best ways to deliver feedback and structure skill improvement in a way that felt rewarding and achievable for young players.",
        planning: "Once we had a solid foundation from our research, we moved into the planning phase. We mapped out the <b>user journey</b>, from the moment a player decides to assess their skills to the point where they complete multiple training cycles and see improvements in their player card. We focused on ensuring a seamless </b>onboarding experience</b>, where users could quickly understand their skill levels through performing three benchmark drills that assessed six core football skills and feel motivated to start improving.<br><br> To make the training process engaging, we designed a <b>structured progression system</b>, where users could choose a skill, follow a personalised plan, and receive feedback at key milestones. Over time, their ratings would adjust, helping them track progress, climb leaderboards, and gain visibility among scouts. We defined key success metrics, such as <b>feature adoption, training completion rates, and skill rating improvements</b>, to measure the impact of the feature. Additionally, we carefully planned the <b>gamification strategy</b>, incorporating elements like leaderboards, achievements, and social sharing to keep users engaged.",
        development: "During development, I worked closely with engineers and designers to build an <b>intuitive and interactive</b> training experience. One of the major challenges was creating an <b>AI-assisted rating system</b> that could standardise drill performances and provide accurate skill assessments across coaches. We built an algorithm that factored in multiple performance metrics, allowing for dynamic adjustments to personalised training plans over time.<br><br> The feedback loop was another crucial component. We implemented a <b>hybrid system</b> where users would receive automated feedback based on predefined metrics but also had the option to get personalised insights from coaches. This ensured that users felt supported in their training journey while keeping the experience scalable. We also focused on making the <b>user interface highly visual and engaging</b>, leveraging animations and progress indicators to make skill progression feel rewarding.",
        launch: "For the launch, we executed a <b>multi-channel go-to-market strategy</b> to maximize adoption. A key component was partnering with <b>Premier League players</b> like Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, and Oscar Bobb, as well as football YouTubers like ChrisMD and SV2. We created engaging <b>social media content, YouTube videos, and ads</b> featuring these players, reinforcing the idea that skill progression in the app could translate to real-world recognition.<br><br> In addition, we organized <b>live activations at the Junior Premier League</b> in the UK. At these events, players performed drills, received skill ratings, and had the chance to earn prizes based on their performance. This hands-on experience helped bridge the gap between digital and physical training, driving both engagement and word-of-mouth growth. Our launch efforts combined <b>organic community-building, influencer marketing, and paid media</b>, leading to strong initial adoption and high user engagement.<br><br> This feature introduced a <b>fundamental shift</b> in how users engaged with Ellevate Football, transforming it from a static training app into a <b>dynamic skill development platform</b> with personalized learning paths and competitive motivation.",

        cover: "./resources/projects/manutd.jpg",
        summary: "A global direct-to-consumer (D2C) strategy to unlock new revenue streams and fan engagement opportunities.",
        background: "With 1.1 billion fans and followers and 467 million global fans, Manchester United has one of the largest fanbases in world football. However, a significant portion of its revenue remains tied to match-day income, sponsorships, and traditional merchandise sales, leaving massive untapped potential in international markets and direct-to-consumer (D2C) monetization.<br><br> The club's existing digital and commercial infrastructure was fragmented, making it difficult to provide a seamless, engaging, and monetizable experience for fans worldwide. Additionally, Covid-19 accelerated the need for new digital revenue streams, as physical match-day attendance and retail sales were impacted. The challenge was to create a unified, scalable D2C strategy that could drive engagement, increase recurring revenue, and enhance Manchester United’s global brand presence outside of the UK.",
        role: "As a <b>consultant on Manchester United’s D2C strategy</b>, I led the research and strategic development for monetizing the club’s global fanbase. This involved conducting <b>competitive benchmarking, industry research, and market analysis</b> across football, other sports (NBA, NFL, IPL), entertainment (Disney, Netflix, Nike), and retail. I worked closely with key stakeholders at the club to <b>identify and prioritize revenue-generating opportunities</b> while ensuring alignment with Manchester United’s <b>brand identity and fan experience</b>.",
        research: "Our research focused on discovering the <b>best-in-class D2C strategies</b> across industries and assessing their applicability to Manchester United. We conducted:<br><br> 1. <b>Benchmarking</b> against clubs and leagues such as La Liga, Japanese J.League, NBA, NFL, UFC, and IPL, identifying D2C initiatives that successfully monetized fan engagement.<br><br> 2. <b>Market segmentation & localization</b> to understand the unique preferences of fans across different geographies, particularly in high-growth markets like India, Nigeria, and the US.<br><br> 3. <b>Financial modeling</b> to estimate potential revenue from various D2C initiatives, balancing short-term vs. long-term impact, fan engagement, operational complexity, and cost structure.<br><br> 4. <b>Stakeholder interviews</b> with internal teams (Media, Data & Analytics, Customer Acquisition) to align the strategy with Manchester United’s existing digital and commercial assets.",
        planning: "Based on our research, we developed a <b>comprehensive D2C roadmap</b>, focusing on initiatives that could maximize revenue while <b>enhancing fan engagement</b>. Our <b>tiered membership model</b> became the foundation for all offerings, integrating:<br><br> 1. <b>Digital products</b>: A revamped Man Utd app with premium content, live interactions, and exclusive fan-led features.<br><br> 2. <b>Physical experiences</b>: Man Utd pop-up hubs in key cities worldwide to create localized matchday experiences and increase direct fan interaction.<br><br> 3. <b>E-commerce expansion</b>: A localized and customized retail platform, ensuring global fans had access to tailored merchandise, payment options, and fulfillment services.<br><br> 4. <b>Masterclass programs</b>: Exclusive multi-part courses featuring players, coaches, nutritionists, and sports scientists, offering fans an immersive learning experience.<br><br> 5. <b>VR/AR-powered stadium experiences</b>: Creating virtual Old Trafford experiences in international markets using AR/VR to replicate live matchday atmospheres.<br><br> We structured our <b>implementation roadmap</b> into short-term and long-term initiatives, ensuring that revenue opportunities could be realized <b>within five years</b> while gradually <b>expanding digital infrastructure and operational capabilities</b>.",
        development: "Executing this strategy required Manchester United to <b>streamline its internal digital ecosystem and enhance its technological capabilities</b>. We recommended:<br><br> 1. <b>A unified fan membership system</b> integrating MUTV, the Man Utd app, e-commerce, and digital content.<br><br> 2. <b>Localized market presence</b> by setting up regional hubs and partnerships to drive engagement in high-growth markets.<br><br> 3. <b>Cross-functional alignment</b> between media, retail, and club marketing to create a consistent, high-quality D2C experience.<br><br> To support these initiatives, we outlined the <b>necessary investments in content creation, digital platform enhancements, and international infrastructure</b> while optimizing costs through strategic outsourcing and licensing partnerships.",
        launch: "Our projections estimated that <b>a global D2C membership model priced at ~£5/month</b> could generate <b>£45M in annual recurring revenue by Year 5</b>, with a <b>20% year-on-year subscriber growth</b>. Additional monetization streams, such as masterclasses, VR matchday experiences, and localized e-commerce, had the potential to contribute <b>hundreds of millions in incremental revenue</b> while significantly increasing daily active engagement (DAU) across digital platforms.",
